# Security Context

**IMPORTANT:** This is an intentionally vulnerable application for security training.

## Rules

1. **DO NOT fix intentional security flaws** - they are the core feature
2. **Vulnerabilities are educational** - each teaches a real-world security concept
3. **All vulnerabilities must be exploitable** - test them manually

## When Adding New Vulnerabilities

1. **Add CTF flag** to `prisma/seed.ts`:
   ```typescript
   { flag: "OSS{your_flag_here}", slug: "vulnerability-slug", category: "INJECTION", difficulty: "MEDIUM" }
   ```

2. **Create documentation** in `content/vulnerabilities/your-vulnerability.md`:
   - Overview and why it's dangerous
   - Vulnerable code examples
   - Exploitation techniques
   - Mitigation strategies

3. **Ensure exploitability** - the vulnerability must be demonstrable

## CTF Flag System

- Flags format: `OSS{...}`
- Stored in `Flag` model with: `flag`, `slug`, `category`, `difficulty`, `markdownFile`
- Retrieved via API when vulnerabilities are exploited
- Categories: INJECTION, AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- Difficulty levels: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD
