description: A technical analysis of CVE-2025-55182, demonstrating how React Server Components deserialization leads to remote code execution.
---

This writeup walks through CVE-2025-55182, a remote code execution bug in React Server Components. The vulnerability sits in the Flight protocol's deserialization logic and requires no authentication to exploit.

## Table of contents

## Lab environment setup

You need a running instance of OopsSec Store. From an empty directory:

```bash
npx create-oss-store oss-store
cd oss-store
npm start
```

Head to `http://localhost:3000` and make sure the app loads.

## Vulnerability overview

React Server Components (RSC) talk to the server through a serialization protocol called Flight. When the browser loads a page or fetches server components, it sends Flight requests to the root endpoint.

The server-side deserializer processes this serialized component data without validating property names. That missing check is what makes React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182) possible.

## Exploitation

### Intercepting requests with Burp Suite

Set up Burp Suite to intercept HTTP traffic:

1. Open Burp Suite and navigate to Proxy → Intercept
2. Enable interception
3. Configure your browser to use Burp as an HTTP proxy (127.0.0.1:8080), or use Burp's built-in browser
4. Reload `http://localhost:3000`
5. Forward the intercepted request to allow the page to load
6. Right-click any captured request and select "Send to Repeater"
7. Disable interception and switch to the Repeater tab

### Crafting the payload

Replace the entire request in Burp Repeater with the exploit payload from the [CVE-2025-55182 proof of concept repository](https://github.com/kOaDT/poc-cve-2025-55182). The payload abuses the Flight protocol to inject JavaScript that runs on the server.

### Firing it off

Send the modified request. The server tries to deserialize it as a normal Server Components response but ends up executing the injected code instead.

## Retrieving the flag

The HTTP response comes back as a React error payload. Buried in there are the contents of `.env.local`, including the flag:

```
OSS{r3act2sh3ll}
```

The server ran `cat .env.local` and sent the output back to us.

## Vulnerable code analysis

The bug is in how the RSC deserializer traverses object properties:

```javascript
value = value[path[i]];
```

There's no allowlist of permitted property names, no own-property check, and the full prototype chain is accessible. So when an attacker supplies `constructor` as a property name, the deserializer resolves:

```javascript
chunk.constructor.constructor === Function;
```

That's the `Function` constructor. From there:

```javascript
Function("malicious code")();
```

Game over. The whole thing boils down to trusting client-controlled property names during deserialization.

## Impact

With RCE on the server, what happens next depends on the environment. An attacker could read secrets straight out of environment variables and config files, drop a cryptominer or backdoor, pivot into internal networks through cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), or, if the server has publish access to a package registry, poison downstream dependencies.

## Remediation

If you're running Next.js or any framework that uses React Server Components:

1. Upgrade React to the latest patched version
2. Upgrade Next.js to the latest patched version
3. Redeploy

CVE-2025-55182 dropped on December 3, 2025. Working exploits showed up within hours, and active exploitation was spotted the next day. Patch now if you haven't already.
